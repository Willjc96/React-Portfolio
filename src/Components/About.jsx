				Hi i'm Will! I'm a psychology graduate who, since graduating, has discovered his real passion is less about how a human mind functions and
				more so how a computers mind does.
			</p>

			<p>
				Up until 2020 I had heard of coding and the uses of it, but never actually understood what any of it meant or what a "GitHub" was. I can't
				remember the exact reason for me wanting to give it a try but I quickly found that it was something that just made sense to me. I'm a very
				logical thinker so understanding the very basics was fairly easy for me. Over time I discovered the wide range of languages and programmes
				that I wanted to try and learn but had to focus my attention to working on one thing at a time, this fuelled my passion for wanting to
				continue to learn.
			</p>

			<p>
				Due to a previous lack of formal experience in software engineering, I realised that the best way to add to what I had already learnt through
				Youtube tutorials, was to get some proper training from a coding bootcamp, which lead me to Northcoders.
			</p>

			<p>
				Outside of coding i'm a big film buff as well as being a huge fan of video gaming. My (not so) guilty pleasure is Pok√©mon which i've also
				incorporated into some of my coding passion projects that i've made in my spare time. When i'm not stuck at home due to a worldwide pandemic,
				I enjoy meeting up with friends, playing tennis, badminton, football and spending way too many hours at the pool table.
